TI  - COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and associated factors among parents of children 
      between 6 and 12 years: a multicenter mixed method study in India.
PG  - 1513419
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2025.1513419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well recognized that parents play a central role in making 
      decisions for their children. Understanding willingness of parents to vaccinate 
      their children against COVID-19 is important as it helps to develop effective 
      strategies for maximizing vaccination coverage. We aimed to evaluate parental 
      acceptance regarding COVID-19 vaccination for children between 6 and 12 years of 
      age in India. METHODS: A mixed-method study (March-September 2023) employed a 
      structured questionnaire and in-depth interviews with parents of school-going and 
      non-school-going children across five purposively selected Indian states. 
      Multistage random sampling was used for districts, schools, and students, while 
      convenience sampling was applied for qualitative data. Multivariable logistic 
      regression assessed factors influencing parental acceptance of COVID-19 
      vaccination, and qualitative analysis identified barriers and facilitators. 
      RESULTS: A total of 2017 parents participated in the study. The overall parental 
      acceptance to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 was 76.4%. Multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis showed that parents who were literate (p = 0.004), 
      not vaccinated against COVID-19 (p = 0.012), had less than or equal to four 
      family members (p < 0.001) and a history of COVID-19 infection in the family 
      (p = 0.036) were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine for their children. 
      Key barriers to vaccination included uncertainty over the protection provided by 
      the vaccine, fear about side effects, and misconceptions about the vaccine 
      whereas belief in the vaccine, perceived severity of COVID-19 disease, and 
      bundling with routine vaccination were the key facilitators. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings highlight the importance of increasing adult COVID-19 vaccination. 
      Developing policies focusing on parents with higher literacy, staying in smaller 
      families, and previous COVID-19 infection among family members will help to 
      increase the vaccine uptake among children. Interventions for the integration of 
      these vaccines with routine immunization or availability at schools may help in 
      increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.

TI  - COVID-19 and Influenza Vaccine Uptake Among Nurses and Children Living in Their 
      Households: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - e71018
LID - 10.1002/hsr2.71018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children are at lower risk from influenza and COVID-19 than other age 
      groups, but they can still be affected. Some adults, including healthcare 
      workers, developed negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, which might lead to lowered pediatric vaccine uptake. We 
      investigated COVID-19 and seasonal flu vaccine uptake among nurses and children 
      living in their households. METHODS: Using contact information from the state 
      professional licensing body, we recruited 677 nurses from South Dakota with 
      children living in their households to participate in an online survey. Data were 
      collected in May 2024. The survey included questions regarding parental and 
      pediatric vaccine uptake and social and political factors associated with vaccine 
      hesitancy. We used logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS: We found 
      that 64% were vaccinated for influenza and 18% of children were vaccinated for 
      COVID-19. The pediatric uptake of both vaccines was associated with parental 
      COVID-19 vaccination status and partially with influenza vaccination status. 
      Nurses who identified with the Republican Party reported lowered vaccination 
      rates for children living in their households. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found low 
      COVID-19 and flu vaccination rates among children in our sample.

TI  - Self-Reported Behavior Change After a Positive COVID-19 Test Result.
PG  - 100367
LID - 10.1016/j.focus.2025.100367 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: U.S. investment in COVID-19 testing and diagnostics provided more 
      than 1 billion tests to vulnerable populations across the nation; however, the 
      impact of testing on behaviors that lead to transmission has not been previously 
      assessed. METHODS: Outbreaks Near Me collects crowdsourced data from volunteer 
      participants to help citizens and public health agencies identify hotspots for 
      COVID-19. Outbreaks Near Me also collects data on what actions individuals take 
      after testing positive for COVID-19. RESULTS: Data collection from November 2022 
      through September 2023 showed that most people (75%) reported at least 2 
      precautions to protect others from contracting COVID-19. The overwhelming 
      majority of those who reported measures (81%) indicated that they will continue 
      to practice those precautions until they have a negative test result or are at 
      least 10 days after the initial positive result. In addition, receiving a 
      positive test was the catalyst for 48% to seek medical care or COVID-19 
      therapeutics, demonstrating that among this volunteer participant population, 
      testing is impactful in preventing spread and adverse health outcomes from 
      infection. Covariates included age, sex, race and ethnicity, comorbidities, 
      vaccination status, and occupation in the healthcare industry. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that high proportion of individuals who tested positive for 
      COVID-19 were likely to take precautions to protect others and to seek medical 
      care or treatment. Overall, behavior change was found to be higher among those 
      aged >65 years, among females, among those who received or intended to receive a 
      booster vaccination, and among those with 2 or more comorbidities. Nearly half of 
      individuals sought either medical care or treatment after testing. These findings 
      support continued investment in testing and diagnostics to prevent and mitigate 
      the spread of COVID-19 and emphasize the importance of testing and diagnostics as 
      part of medical countermeasures' role in pandemic preparedness and response.

AB  - Lactococcus lactis bacterium can be genetically modified to transport the spike 
      protein from SARS-CoV-2, making it a potential candidate for a COVID-19 mucosal 
      vaccine. This study aimed to optimize the nisin concentration, pH, incubation 
      time, and media composition to induce spike protein expression. The 
      concentrations of nisin used in this study ranged from 0 to 40 ng/mL, the 
      incubation period was 3 to 24 hr, and the pH of the growth media ranged from 4 to 
      8. The media was also supplemented with various yeast extract and sucrose 
      concentrations. The highest protein band intensity was observed at a 
      concentration of 40 ng/mL and an incubation period of 9 hr. Supplementation with 
      4% w/v yeast extract and 6% w/v sucrose significantly increased the expression of 
      HCR spike protein. In silico simulation suggested a maximal protein band 
      intensity of 70.95 arbitrary units, while the nisin concentration needed to 
      produce half the maximal protein band intensity was estimated to be 9.599 ng/mL. 
      No significant difference in spike protein expression was found between pH 
      variations. The media composition, inducer, and incubation time strongly affect 
      the spike protein expression.

AB  - COVID-19 and seasonal influenza have taken a huge toll on the global economy and 
      global health. Given the potential of COVID-19 to transform into a chronic 
      epidemic akin to seasonal influenza, the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 will 
      continue to be a significant threat to healthcare for some time to come. 
      Coinfection involving the two viruses has been proven to worsen the severity of 
      the illness, as evidenced by clinical observational data. Vaccination remains the 
      most effective measure in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. In 
      addition, the coadministration of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines offered 
      greater benefits than either vaccine alone. Combination vaccines are also a major 
      hotspot in novel vaccine development. This review highlights the advancements in 
      the development of combined vaccines for COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, as 
      demonstrated in animal studies and clinical trials, and emphasizes the importance 
      of a combined vaccine.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccination and Infection in Myasthenia Gravis: A Longitudinal Patient 
      Survey.
LID - 10.1002/mus.28466 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) often receive 
      immunosuppressive treatments. While approved COVID-19 vaccines effectively 
      prevent severe infections, the impact of vaccination among immunocompromised MG 
      patients remains unclear. This study explored vaccination status, adverse events, 
      and post-vaccination outcomes among MG patients. METHODS: A REDCap survey was 
      conducted between September 21, 2021 and November 18, 2021 through the Myasthenia 
      Gravis Foundation of America to collect data on demographic and disease 
      characteristics, COVID-19 infections, vaccination status, and precaution 
      strategies. A follow-up survey was available from January 11, 2022 to March 8, 
      2022. RESULTS: A total of 1205 participants [65.7% female, average age 
      59.6 +/- 15.4 years] completed the survey. Most were White or Caucasian (87.9%), 
      63.6% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 41.9% were retired. Acetylcholine 
      receptor (AChR) antibody positivity was reported by 47%, MuSK-Ab positivity by 
      6.1%, and 19.6% were seronegative. Most (75%) were on immunosuppressive therapy, 
      and the vaccination rate was 91.5%. Among COVID-19 vaccine recipients, 61.5% 
      reported adverse effects, while 8.5% of participants remained unvaccinated due to 
      concerns about side effects (65%) and potential worsening of MG symptoms (70.9%). 
      Post-vaccination COVID-19 infection rates dropped from 9.7% to 2.4%. 
      Hospitalization decreased from 2.3% to 0.3%, and MG exacerbation rates from 5.5% 
      to 1.4%. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 vaccination acceptance is high among MG patients. 
      Reported side effects in MG patients were comparable to those in the general 
      population, and vaccination was associated with a reduced COVID-19 infection 
      rate. Addressing concerns about vaccine side effects and providing efficacy data 
      specific to MG could aid unvaccinated individuals in decision-making.

TI  - Rocky Mountain West COVID-19 Modeling: A Descriptive Assessment of Public Health 
      Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Endemic Transition in Summer 2022.
PG  - 333549251320909
LID - 10.1177/00333549251320909 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although federal funding for COVID-19 pandemic response measures has 
      ended, opportunities remain to understand the needs of public health departments 
      and the potential use of infectious disease models in the postacute pandemic 
      response. We conducted semistructured interviews with public health 
      representatives representing state, local, and regional/tribal public health 
      departments in the Rocky Mountain West in summer 2022 to understand their 
      COVID-19 priorities, decision-making needs, and data resources. METHODS: We 
      interviewed representatives from 6 organizations representing 3 state, local, and 
      regional/tribal public health departments in the Rocky Mountain West. RESULTS: 
      From interviews, priorities included having timely information on vaccines, being 
      able to anticipate COVID-19 demands on hospitals, understanding the potential 
      effects of emerging variants, and communicating immunity concepts to the public. 
      Decisions focused on making public health recommendations as opposed to mandates. 
      Multiple interviewees reported limited access to timely COVID-19 data, challenges 
      tracking COVID-19 hospitalizations, and a desire for communication tools on 
      vaccinations and immunity. CONCLUSION: Although COVID-19 models can provide 
      forecasts on hospital demand and project the effects of vaccines and variants in 
      the endemic period, major gaps in data continue to challenge the public health 
      response. Continued investments are needed in data and surveillance resources to 
      respond to COVID-19 and to prepare for future pandemics.

TI  - Exploring co-infection dynamics and immune response interactions between COVID-19 
      and Monkeypox: implications for disease severity, viral transmission, and vaccine 
      efficacy.
PG  - 230
LID - 10.1186/s12985-025-02857-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and Monkeypox (Mpox) are viral 
      infections that have similar modes of presentation, diagnosis and treatment 
      strategies. Understanding their co-infection dynamics and immune response is 
      important for public health policies. AIM: This article aims to determine the 
      relationship between dynamicity and immune response interactions between Mpox and 
      COVID-19, focusing more on the implications for disease severity, viral 
      transmission, and vaccine efficacy. METHODOLOGY: An extensive literature review 
      was conducted through electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and 
      Web of Science from the last decade (2014-2024) using keywords: COVID-19, 
      Co-infections, Immune response, Monkeypox, and Vaccination. RESULTS: Several 
      co-infections between COVID-19 and Mpox have been reported, especially a case 
      from Florida, in the United States of America (USA), in Barcelona, Spain (a 
      56-year-old man who suffered both Mpox and COVID-19 and syphilis simultaneously, 
      and from Italy (a 36-year-old male). Both COVID-19 and Mpox have been shown to 
      have some effects on the immunity of a person, especially the innate system, 
      which can occasionally produce inadvertent effects. A common factor that links 
      the two diseases is the endoglycosidase named Heparanase (HPSE). Both COVID-19 
      and Mpox clinical features have bizarre severity and complications. The rising 
      co-infection of COVID-19 and increased Mpox infection rate has led to the 
      development of only approved vaccines JYNNEOS and COH04S1. CONCLUSION: Global 
      efforts such as adequate awareness campaigns through webinars, social media 
      platforms, and research, including experimental studies, cohort studies, case 
      series, etc., should be put in place to give more insights into both diseases. 
      Such efforts should be backed up with good political will, adequate funding, the 
      establishment of research facilities and interprofessional measures among the 
      concerned countries and policymakers in the world.
